FMR: For My Reference

Starting point of the code is index.html. In index.html we define the id of the starting element of the code("root").
Wherever this id is defined and implemented from there the code starts running.
In our case it is in index.js, there the initialization of react object is done and inside that there is a jsx code which runs.
I that code we define the functional components.

Functional components:(FMR: This is just like Widgets in flutter)
Functional components is a normal js func with which we can render the view and data on the browser.

PropTypes:
prop-types in react is used to define the variables passed to a functional component.
We can have required variables and also can have default values to variables.

Added the bootstrap script in the code so that if you want you can just go and pick the ui code from bootstrap website and use it.

It is a good practice to have different components for different things so that you can reuse the components in multiple places.

React Hooks:
Use State: this is used to add a state variable which can change its value when you need
(FMR: this is just like value notifier in flutter)
